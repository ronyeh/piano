## Audio

First, we will need to play individual notes from our virtual piano. We can use a JS library for this. Here are two that are easy to use:
* Musical
* Tone

```js
alert('Hello World');
```

## Graphics

Let's make some graphics for our piano. We will use SVG.

```js
alert('Hello World');
```

## Interaction

Now we need to let the user interact with the piano, through the mouse and keyboard (or through tapping on a touch screen).

```js
alert('Hello World');
```
